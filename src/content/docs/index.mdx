## Elevate CSS
### End the Guessing Game
Designer: "Use large spacing here."

You: "Is that `pd:4`? `pd:6`? `pd:8`?"
Checks three components. Finds three different answers.
Six months later: "Large spacing is now 20px instead of 24px."

You: Searches 47 files. Changes 23 classes. Ships inconsistent spacing.
What if your CSS just knew what "large" meant?

<br/>
<br/>

<div id = "starfield">
</div>
<div id="fluid-bg">

  <canvas id="MarqueeCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
<script src="/fluid.js" defer></script>

<Aside type="caution" title="Please Excuse Our Progress">
In its current iteration (v1.05 - Beta), Elevate CSS is in active development and subject to change. Your feedback is invaluable as this project evolves into a fully realized utility framework.
</Aside>

<br/>

## Write What You Mean

`pd:large` compiles to your design system's exact definition of large padding.
`bg:primary` outputs your brand's actual primary color.
`text:heading` uses your typography scale, not a guess.
When your design system changes, your CSS changes with it. Automatically.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```html
/* In your design system */
spacing: { lg: "2rem" }
colors: { primary: "#3b82f6" }

/* In your code */
pd:lg bg:primary

/* Compiles to exactly */
.pd\:lg {
  padding: 2rem;
}
.bg\:primary {
  background-color: #3b82f6;
}
```

## Design Tokens Make CSS Classes

Your designer updates large from 24px to 20px in the design system. Every pd:large across every component updates instantly. Zero file hunting. Zero missed updates. Zero drift between design and code.
The source of truth stays singular.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="pd:d4:d2 row:x-center:y-center">
  <h1 class ="font:sans:h5 mg-t:d12 /md/ font:h3 /lg/ font:h1">"I Am The Documentation" - Your CSS, Probably.</h1>
</div>
```

<br/>

## Build-time Validation Protects Your Design

Type pd:xlarge when only pd:large exists? Build fails with exact file location.
Use a color token that doesn't exist? Compiler catches it before users see it.
Try spacing values outside your design system? They don't compile.
Your design system becomes enforceable, not just aspirational.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```html
‚ùå Invalid Prefixed Value: Unable to determine spacing value "xlarge"
   in src/components/Button.tsx on line 23

üí° Troubleshooting Tips:
   1. Examine your prefixed value and ensure it matches the expected token type.
   2. If this is a custom modifier, ensure that you are using the correct syntax.

## Syntax Built For Real Components

Grouped state changes: @hover:[bg:darker_text:white_scale:105] keeps related hover effects together instead of scattered across class lists.
Smart responsive design: /tablet/ w:8 /desktop/ w:full adapts when you change breakpoint pixel values.
Directional shortcuts: pd:large for all sides, pd:large:medium for asymmetric padding that follows CSS shorthand logic.
Escape hatch for edge cases: margin:(2rem_auto) when you need raw CSS values.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="w:c6 /md/ w:c8 /xl/ w:full">
  <h1 class ="text:white:center">I'm Spatially Aware</h1>
</div>
```

<br/>

---

<br/>

## States Without The Mess

Contextual styling that groups related properties together instead of scattering them across your class list like `hover:bg-blue-600 hover:text-white hover:scale-105`. No more hunting through dozens of classes to find which hover states belong to which element, or wondering if you forgot to add a focus state that matches your hover state. Everything that changes together stays together, making interactive components predictable and maintainable.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="pd:d4:d2 row:x-center:y-center">
  <div class ="w:full bg-color:green @hover:[bg-color:red_font:semibold_text:white]"><p>What Happens On Hover, Again?</p></div>
</div>
```

## Simple Setup, Powerful Results

Install package. Configure design tokens. Write utilities.
Built-in file watching, automatic compilation, and detailed error messages with line numbers. No webpack configuration. No build script modifications. No plugin dependencies.


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Generated on Demand" icon="rocket">
    Zero pre-built utilities. CSS gets compiled from your design tokens exactly when you write it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build-Time Validation" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Type `pd:xlarge` instead of `pd:xl` and your build fails immediately. Typos become compiler errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Semantic Utilities" icon="seti:css">
    `bg:primary` tells you design intent. `bg-blue-500` tells you nothing about why that color was chosen.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design System Driven" icon="open-book">
    Your tokens define your utilities. Change your design system and every component updates automatically.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>


<br/>
<br/>

## For Teams Who Ship Consistently

Your design system defines spacing tokens but developers still guess at values.
Your brand guidelines specify colors but CSS files contain hex codes and approximations.
Your design team works in systematic scales while your code accumulates magic numbers.
Elevate bridges this gap. Your design system becomes your CSS vocabulary.

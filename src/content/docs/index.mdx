## The System Knows the Way

Designer: "Use large spacing here."

You: "Is that `pd:4`, `pd:6`, or `pd:8`?"

Checks three components. Finds three different answers.

Six months later "large" is now 20px instead of 24px.

Searches 47 files. Changes 23 classes. Still shipped inconsistent spacing.

What if your CSS just knew what "large" meant to your design system?

<br/>
<br/>

<div id = "starfield">
</div>
<div id="fluid-bg">

  <canvas id="MarqueeCanvas"></canvas>
</div>
<script src="/fluid.js" defer></script>

<Aside type="caution" title="Please Excuse Our Progress">
In its current iteration (v1.05 - Beta), Elevate CSS is in active development and subject to change. Your feedback is invaluable as this project evolves into a fully realized utility framework.
</Aside>


## Write What You Mean

`pd:large` compiles to your design system's exact definition of large padding.
`bg:primary` outputs your brand's actual primary color.
`text:heading` uses your typography scale, not a guess.
When your design system changes, your CSS changes with it. Automatically.

<br/>
<br/>
```html
/* In your design system */
spacing: { lg: "2rem" }
colors: { primary: "#3b82f6" }

/* In your code */
pd:lg bg:primary

/* Compiles to exactly */
.pd\:lg {
  padding: 2rem;
}
.bg\:primary {
  background-color: #3b82f6;
}
```


<br/>



<br/>

## Design Tokens Define CSS Classes

Your designer updates large from 24px to 20px in the design system. Every `pd:large` across every component updates instantly. Zero file hunting. Zero missed updates. Zero drift between design and code.
The source of truth stays singular.

<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="pd-x:large pd-y:small row:x-center:y-center">
  <h1 class ="font:sans:h5 mg-t:small /md/ font:h3 /lg/ font:h1">Your Design System In CSS</h1>
</div>
```

<br/>
<br/>

## Build-time Validation Protects Your Vision

Type `pd:xlarge` when only `pd:large` exists? Build fails with exact file location.
Use a color token that doesn't exist? Compiler catches it before users see it.
Try spacing values outside your design system? They don't compile.
Your design system becomes enforceable, not just aspirational.

<br/>
<br/>

```html
‚ùå Invalid Prefixed Value: Unable to determine spacing value "xlarge"
   in src/components/Button.tsx on line 23

üí° Troubleshooting Tips:
   1. Examine your prefixed value and ensure it matches the expected token type.
   2. If this is a custom modifier, ensure that you are using the correct syntax.

## Syntax Built For Real Convenience

Grouped state changes: `@hover:[bg:darker_text:white]` keeps related hover effects together instead of scattered across class lists.
Smart responsive design: `/tablet/ w:large /desktop/ w:full` adapts when you change breakpoint pixel values.
Directional shortcuts: `pd:large` for all sides, `pd-x:large` for horizontal padding, `pd-y:large` for vertical padding.

<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="w:mobile /md/ w:tablet /xl/ w:full">
  <h1 class ="text:white:center">I'm Spatially Aware</h1>
</div>
```

<br/>
<br/>

## States Without The Mess

Contextual styling that groups related properties together instead of scattering them across your class list like `hover:bg-blue-600 hover:text-white hover:scale-105`. No more hunting through dozens of classes to find which hover states belong to which element, or wondering if you forgot to add a focus state that matches your hover state. Everything that changes together stays together, making interactive components predictable and maintainable.

<br/>
<br/>

```html
<div class ="pd-x:large pd-y:small row:x-center:y-center">
  <div class ="w:full bg-color:green @hover:[bg-color:red_font:semibold_text:white]"><p>What Happens On Hover, Again?</p></div>
</div>
```

<br/>
<br/>

## Simple Setup, Powerful Results

Install package. Configure design tokens. Write utilities.
Built-in file watching, automatic compilation, and detailed error messages with line numbers. No webpack configuration. No build script modifications. No plugin dependencies. And it's mobile first.


<br/>
<br/>


<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Generated on Demand" icon="rocket">
    Zero pre-built utilities. CSS gets compiled from your design tokens exactly when you write it. Ship what you use - 100kb new in the box.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build-Time Validation" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Type `pd:xlarge` instead of `pd:xl` and your build fails immediately. Typos become compiler errors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency, Enforced" icon="seti:css">
    Your utilities compile from design tokens. No approximations, no drift, no guessing which blue to use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design System Driven" icon="open-book">
    Your tokens define your utilities. Change your design system and every component updates automatically.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<br/>
<br/>

## For Teams Who Ship Consistently

Your design system defines spacing tokens but developers still guess at values.
Your brand guidelines specify colors but CSS files contain hex codes and approximations.
Your design team works in systematic scales while your code accumulates magic numbers.
Elevate CSS bridges the gap and your design system becomes the heart of your CSS vocabulary.

## Core Design Principles

- **Expressive and Intentional**  
  Styling choices should serve as self-documenting expressions of design intention, ensuring intuitive understanding and long-term maintainability.

- **Consistency and Consideration**  
  The design system is the single source of truth, rigorously upheld through build-time validation to eliminate off-scale values and unauthorized modifications.

- **Extensible and Reliable**  
  Elevate must support growth and adaptation while maintaining simplicity, with syntax validated at build-time to guarantee alignment with the design system on every build.

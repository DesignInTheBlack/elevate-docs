<summary><strong>Key Benefits</strong></summary>

- **Design-Driven Approach**  
  Enforces strict adherence to design tokens, ensuring consistent and intentional styling decisions aligned with your design system.

- **Build-Time Validation**  
  Catches typos, unauthorized values, and invalid class names during the build process, guaranteeing error-free code before production.

- **Semantic and Declarative Syntax**  
  Intuitive `property:modifier` strings double as living documentation, making classes more readable and maintainable.

- **Scalable Structure**  
  Organized styling categories and token-driven validation support long-term project scalability while maintaining design integrity.

- **Engineering Rigor**  
  Compiler-driven validation integrates engineering principles into front-end styling for a predictable, reliable workflow.

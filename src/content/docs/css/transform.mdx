### `transform` Property Modifiers

| Property   | Expected Values | Example     |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `transform` | PassThroughToken (e.g.,  `(translateX(10px))` ) |  `transform:(translateX(10px))`  |
| `origin` | PassThroughToken (e.g.,  `(top_left)` ) |  `origin:(top_left)`  |

<Aside title="'Pass Through' Means Literally">
When using PassThroughToken based properties or using it in your own custom syntax, remember that the actual CSS value is whatever you pass through. So, if you're using a PassThroughToken for a background image, for example, you must use the `url()` syntax just as you would in a CSS declaration. PassThroughTokens also allow you to write spaces in your utility strings by placing an underscore (_) in place of the space, much like the operator flag (@) does

Elevate includes a set of sensible defaults for most things, but you can always extend them or override them as you see fit. For more information, check out the [Configuration & Extension](/guides/3-configuration/) guide.

## How to Use Breakpoints

In Elevate, breakpoints are applied using the `/breakpoint/` syntax in your class list. For example: 
<br/>
```html
<div class="pd:d4 /lg/ pd:d8 /2xl/ pd:d12">Responsive, Organized</div>
```
